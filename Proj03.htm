<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the official web site for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and  make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2><strong>Typographical Errors</strong></h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know so 
that I can correct the error and notify all of the students. 

<center>
<h2><strong>Java Version Requirement</strong></h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the accompanying document 
titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments</strong> and in the syllabus for this course.</p>

    <tr>
      <td style="height: 1051px"><p>Proj03 Copyright 2014 R.G.Baldwin</p>
		<p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write a program named <strong>Proj03</strong> (that uses the driver 
		class definition provided in the file named<strong> Proj03.java</strong>)
		that can be used to connect to, 
		download, render, and navigate simple web pages as shown in  <strong>Image01</strong>, 
		 <strong>Image02</strong>, and  <strong>Image03</strong>. <em>(By simple, I mean web pages that do not 
		contain frames, automatic forwarding, and other fancy HTML features.)</em></p>
	  <p>Your program must provide a <strong>Back</strong> button and a <strong>Forward</strong> button as shown 
	  in <strong>Image01</strong>. You can navigate through simple web pages by clicking 
	  hyperlinks with the mouse. You can backtrack your navigation path using 
	  the <strong>Back</strong> button and then move forward through your navigation path using 
	  the <strong>Forward</strong> button.</p>
	  <p>You can navigate to a particular web page by entering the URL in the 
	  text field shown at the top of  <strong>Image01</strong>. <em>(Note that 
	  if the URL is too long to fit in the text field, part of the URL won't be 
	  visible.)</em></p>
	  <p>To make it easier for me to to test and grade your assignment, cause your program to 
	  default to the following web page at startup by automatically entering the 
	  following URL in the text field and by automatically opening the 
	  corresponding web page in your output:</p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/tocdsp.htm">
	  http://www.dickbaldwin.com/tocdsp.htm</a> </p>
	  <p>Once there, you should be able to navigate to any of the following 
	  simple web pages:</p>
			  <p><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/dsp/Dsp00100.htm">100</a>  
			  Periodic Motion and Sinusoids<br/>
			  <a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/dsp/Dsp00104.htm">104</a>  
			  Sampled Time Series<br/>
			  <a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/dsp/Dsp00108.htm">108</a>  
			  Averaging Time Series </p>
	  <p><em>(You may be able to navigate to other web pages as well, but many 
	  of the links on that page point to pages that contain HTML features that your program 
	  is not required to support.)</em></p>
	  <p>Your program output must provide scroll bars when needed as shown in 
	   <strong>Image01</strong>.</p>
	  <p>You must be able to use hyperlinks, the mouse, the mouse wheel, the scroll bars, the
	  <strong>Back</strong> button, and the <strong>Forward</strong> button to 
	  expose the material shown in <strong>Image01</strong>, <strong>Image02</strong>, 
	  and <strong>Image03</strong>.</p>
	  <p>You must also display the following text on the command-line screen.</p>
	  <pre>I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Print your name here.</pre>
	  <p>Submit only the source code file named <strong>Proj03Runner.java</strong>.</p>
